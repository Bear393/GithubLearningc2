# GithubLearningc2
My personal project for building a simple to-do list web app while learning Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals at my own pace.

Updated 20 Sep 2025 11:16

## Project Overview
This repository chronicles the minimalist task manager I am crafting to run entirely in the browser. It is tailored specifically for how I like to organize tasks and experiment with GitHub workflows.

I use the project as a sandbox to understand how HTML structures the page, how CSS adds visual polish, and how JavaScript brings interactivity to the to-do list.

## Features
- Browser-based task list you can view by opening `index.html` directly.
- Simple styling with `style.css` so you can experiment with layout, colors, and typography.
- Interactive task management powered by `app.js`, where you can add, toggle, and organize items.
- Lightweight setup that helps me focus on learning Git commits, branches, and pull requests.

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/GithubLearningc2.git`
2. Open the project folder and double-click `index.html`, or serve it with a simple HTTP server.
3. Start adding, checking off, and organizing tasks to see the live updates in your browser.
